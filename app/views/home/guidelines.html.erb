        <h4 class='text-submit'>DO:</h4>
        <ul class='section-list'>
          <li><b>Be nice.</b> We value diversity and encourage lively debate. We want people to feel safe and welcome posting here. Please be polite and respectful in your interactions.</li>
          <li><b>Be relevant.</b> Please keep your posts on topic. When you introduce a new topic, please create a new post. Use headlines to help others find your content later on.</li>
          <li><b>Seek advice & share solutions.</b> Strive to shed more light than heat on a subject.</li>
          <li><b>Share your expertise!</b> Aim to post content that is informative, educational or encourages discussion.</li>
          <li><b>Be yourself.</b> You don't need to share your real name, but you should not be impersonating anyone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class='text-submit'>DON'T:</h4>
        <ul class='section-list'>
          <li>Post content that is confidential, defamatory, misleading or deceptive, offensive, abusive, harassing, threatening, designed to intimidate or bully, or that infringes copyright or contains hate speech.</li>
          <li>Engage in commercial activity. Please do not use this site to promote the sale of goods or services.</li>
          <li>Use all CAPS in comments. Caps might be construed as yelling. Be careful with bolding or underlining – it can sometimes feel aggressive.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class='text-large text-underline'>Engaging in any of the “don’t” behaviors may result in the removal of your contributions, the loss of posting privileges, or the deletion of your account.</p>
